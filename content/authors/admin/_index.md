I study innovation, invention, and scientific discovery by examining the systems through which governments hope to accelerate these human endeavours. Most of my work sits at the boundary of complex systems and innovation studies, and patent data is usually my noisy indicator of choice when it comes to studying intermediate outputs of the invention process.

Since May 2020 I have been a postdoctoral fellow at the [Institute of Innovation Research](https://www.iir.hit-u.ac.jp/en/) based at Hitotsubashi University, Japan. Prior to this role, I was a postdoc in the [Chair of Innovation and IP Policy](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/iipp/) at EPFL (headed by [Gaétan de Rassenfosse](https://gder.phpnet.org/rassenfosse/bio.html)). My PhD was obtained from Victoria University of Wellington under the supervision of Michele Governale, Adam B Jaffe, and Uli Zülicke, and was funded by [Te Pūnaha Matatini](https://www.tepunahamatatini.ac.nz/).
